#Timed Quiz Project

This quiz required us to create a quiz with a countdown timer.

The player high score is determined by the time left on the timers and every incorrect answer
resulted in time being subtracted from the countdown timer.

The skills required in this project include HTML for the content od the page,
CSS to style the various elements, and JavaScript to dynamically add content to the page as the player progresses throught the quiz.
